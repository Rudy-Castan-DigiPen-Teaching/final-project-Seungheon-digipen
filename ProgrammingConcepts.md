1. Shapes \nI think some things will be used as images instead of drawing them using draw. It will be used to make the shape of the button used within the game.
2. Colors\nColors will basically be used to color the background, objects, etc. And the first arrow to reach in my game will turn red.
3. Variables\nVariables will be used for the number, score, arrow, arrow speed, mouse position, etc. of each screen.
4. Conditional States\nUse the if() door to allow users to go to the desired screen by pressing a button. Also, when the main character is hit by an arrow, the number of hearts drops. It will be used in many other situations.
5. Loops\nI will make arrows using For loop etc. and control the speed of arrows.
6. Functions\nWe will use various functions such as mouseClick(), keyPressed(), setInterval(), and functions within the class so that users can enjoy the game.
7. Classes\nI will create and use several classes, such as arrow class, main menu class, button class, etc.
8. Arrays\nI will use Arrays to store records on the scoreboard.
