# scenario
Square googly eyes attacked in front of the circled goggly eyes that were traveling. Use shields to block them from the arrows they fly.

# Game idea
MAIN MENU
1. PLAY\n
When the game starts, an arrow flies from the 5th direction. If this arrow hits the circle googly eyes in the middle, the heart is cut one by one. If there are zero hearts, it's game over. Users can use the arrow keys to move the shield. Use this shield to block the flying arrows. Each time you block an arrow, the score goes up by one point. The higher the score, the faster and more arrows. The first arrow to come is shown in red (I don't know if it's feasible.). When the game is over, you will have the option of starting again or going back to the main menu.
2. SCORE BOARD\n
The score history is kept until you run the game and exit. (I don't know if it's feasible.)
3. OPTION\n
Users can adjust background music volume and sfx volume using left and right arrow keys.
